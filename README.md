# Building_Blox

Solved 3 problems that were presented by The Odin Project.  

1. Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string.

2. Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

3. Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
